This breast cancer predictor uses algorithms to analyze clinical and laboratory data of patients to predict the risk of breast cancer recurrence. In a study, eleven different machine learning algorithms were compared, and AdaBoost was found to have the best prediction performance. The model identified CA125, CEA, Fbg, and tumor diameter as the most important features for predicting recurrence. This approach provides a clinical decision support tool for early intervention in high-risk patients, using easily accessible data in clinical practice. Machine learning techniques have shown promising results in breast cancer recurrence prediction, with potential for improved diagnosis and monitoring.
